# *Temperature Distribution Simulation using Finite Element Method*

This project focuses on simulating temperature distribution over time using the Finite Element Method (FEM). It was developed as part of my academic coursework and serves as a great example of implementing advanced mathematical algorithms in a low-level language like C++.  

## Features
- Numerical simulation of temperature distribution in a defined domain  
- Time-dependent analysis for transient heat transfer problems  
- Modular design with a configuration file for easy management of global variables (`config.h`)  

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core language for implementing the algorithms and simulation logic  
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Used for data structures like `std::vector`  

## Why This Project?
This project was developed during a semester-long academic course and provided valuable experience in:  
- Implementing and optimizing numerical methods in C++  
- Managing complexity in low-level programming  

The project highlights the application of mathematical concepts in programming and showcases the efficiency of C++ in computationally intensive tasks.


## How to run?
Download project as ZIP.

Create new C++ project in IDE of your choice e.g. Visual Studio.

Extract "Projekt" directory into your project.

Run main.cpp.



You turn debug mode on and off in "config.h" file..
